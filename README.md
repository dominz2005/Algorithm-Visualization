# Algorithm-Visualization
## Welcome to the algorithm visualization!
I built this application to learn more about algorithms. And I wanted to see them in action. I had a lot of fun creating this tool and I hope you will have a great time watching it work as well. Here is the website link: https://dominz2005.github.io/Algorithm-Visualization/ Have fun! 

### 1. Sorting Algorithms
This tool supports the folowing sorting algorithms:
- **Bubble sort:** a very simple algorithm to describe to a computer.
- **Select sort:** it performs well on a small list.
- **Insertion sort:** a faster sorting method, performs very good on small lists.
- **Bucket sort:** is way more quicker to run than a bubble sort.
- **Merge sort:** very fast even with bigger lists.
- **Quick sort:** its worst-case performance is similar to average performances of the bubble.

### 2. Pathfinding Algorithms
This tool supports the folowing pathfinding algorithms:
- __A* Algorithm:__ one of the best pathfinding algorithm. Often used in video games. Guarantees shortest path.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** fast algorithm and simple to implement. Guarantees the shortest path. 
- **Greedy Best-first Search:** a faster version of A* algorithm. Doesn't guarantee the shortest path.
- **Breath-first Search:** similiar to Dijkstra's algorithm. Guarantee the shortest path.<br/>
*Note that Dijkstra's Algorithm isn't 100% same as the original one. It's because of the algorithms idea, it searches for the closest neighbour, and since all the neighbours are at the same distance, it's just looping threw every neighbour node in random order!*

### 3. Maze Algorithms
This tool supports the folowing maze generation algorithms:
- **Random Maze:** a algorithm that putts walls in random positions.
- **Depth-first Search Maze:** needs the space filled with walls first. Guarantees a way out.
- **Recursive-Division Maze:** diffrent approach to the topic. Guarantees a way out.
- **Prim's Algorithm Maze:** similiar to the depth-first search one. Guarantees a way out.
- **Binary Tree Maze:** very simple way to generate mazes. Not always guarantees a way out.

### 4. Cellular Automata
Yes, this tool even contains a fully customizable cellular automata where cells are walls that you can place on the board. You can access it from the "Maze creation" drop-down window.B means a number of living neighbors that cause a dead cell to come alive, and S means a list of all the numbers of live neighbors that cause a live cell to remain alive.
